# Concept Note – AI‑Mediated Clarity Systems for Societal Well‑Being and Truth

Prepared By: Alec Rogers

Status: Concept Note – For Fellowship, Visiting Researcher, or Grant
Consideration

## 1. Background

Societies today face two converging problems: information abundance
paired with declining clarity, and increasing psychological
fragmentation affecting both individual agency and civic cohesion. My
two‑decade trajectory sits at the intersection of cognition, AI, DSP
engineering, contemplative research, and system design, enabling a
unique approach to these societal challenges.

Relevant prior work includes system‑level AI and DSP engineering at The
MathWorks, negativity‑bias and cognition research via behavioral
experiments, development of a cross‑platform meditation biofeedback
application (Psygraph), and philosophical works on mind and identity
(The Whole Part, Gnostic Models).

## 2. Thesis

AI can be used to make societies wiser—not merely faster or more
efficient.

Hypothesis: If mental clarity, emotional regulation, and
decision‑quality are supported at a population scale, societies improve
in civic participation, misinformation‑resilience, and interpersonal
humanity.

## 3. Proposed Program Components

A. Cognitive‑AI Modeling of Mental Clarity – neural, nonlinear,
fuzzy‑logic‑based conceptual clarity models

B. Measurement & Biofeedback System – mobile and wearable interventions
for clarity and emotional stabilization

C. Truth‑Alignment Infrastructure – transparent digital civic‑feedback
and policy‑insight systems

## 4. Collaboration Format Requested

Seeking placement as Visiting Researcher, Associate Collaborator, or
Fellow; institution provides affiliation, workspace, peer community.
Funding optional; lodging and basic costs can be self‑funded.

## 5. Country Alignment Examples

• Estonia – world‑leading digital society; ideal for clarity‑based
governance prototypes\
• Switzerland – humanitarian and health frameworks; WHO‑adjacent global
impact\
• Taiwan – AI ethics leadership and cultural proximity to contemplative
practice\
• New Zealand – national well‑being economy and psychological‑policy
integration

## 6. Desired Deliverables

Output expected: prototype instruments, published papers, open‑benefit
models, and a reproducible framework for clarity‑based policy insight.
