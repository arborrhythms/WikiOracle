# Future Work

## Network of Trust
- Network of trust that supports diverse, multi-tenant models of what an individual finds true, similar to DDNS, instead of a monolithic body of truth governed by monopolistic corporations with product motives, advertising budgets, and mandates to capture attention.
- Pseudonymous participation in that network, allowing alignment with individual values within that distributed space.

## Sentence-Level Prediction
- Change the next-step prediction model to a syntactically structured derivation of sentence meaning, so that token prediction becomes prediction of the sentence (as a token), of the NP+VP (as two tokens), ... until the sull sentence has been specified. This would take the same number of production steps as a current LLM, but the iterative refinement of the next-sentece production is conceptually much different, and closer to human reasoning and refinement where there is a core truth (S) and spatial NP and temporal VP whihc are successively refined by adjectives and adverbs that scope the conceptual space of that kernel sentence.
- A training and testing dataset for the network consisting of truth statements and implications with associated truth values.

## Merological Operations on Conceptual Space
- Make improvements to NanoChat that allow it to compute truth within the geometric/conceptual space of the network, giving meaning to logical operations within that space (so use mereological operations to implement the ternary logic that is currently operating over the trust entries of the HME architecture in the current design). This means replacing AND with union, OR with intersection, IMPLICATION with parthood. See [Socrates.pdf](Socrates.pdf) for a quick sketch of deriving mereological (Venn-diagram-like) logic from entailment.
